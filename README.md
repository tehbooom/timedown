# timedown

First project in rust and count down until im free

Rust is hard so i looked to [this issue](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/416) for help

This only provides me the years months a days but now i need to provide hours and seconds in print each second the new difference

I want to provide the binary with a date and it starts a countdown to that date `timedown mm-dd-yyyy`
